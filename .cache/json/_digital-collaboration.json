These best practices will create a space that enables                  team members to build a collaborative culture that will serve                  as a competitive advantage. Here are some features of an                  internal communications portal to look for when selecting a                  platform on which to move your team’s digital presence:                </p>                <ul class=\"blog-details__ul blog-details__ul--bolded\">                  <li>                    <b class=\"fw-9\">                      Use a platform that allows real-time collaboration:                    </b>                  </li>                  <p>                    Different real-time collaboration tools have their own sets                    of features to accommodate group interaction. Some involve                    instant messaging and other real-time communication tools,                    others involve collaborative real-time editing, where files                    can be amended or altered jointly in real-time.                  </p>\n                  <li>                    <b class=\"fw-9\">Use an app with one central location: </b>                  </li>                  <p>                    The ability to access and connect to files, attachments,                    services, and messages from multiple sources in a central                    location allows employees to centralize key aspects of their                    job in a single location. Organizations struggle to grow and                    manage costs effectively using disparate software                    applications. This disconnected collection of software                    applications causes process bottlenecks and training                    challenges. Using the team portal reduces access and                    complexity issues for employees.                  </p>\n                  <li>                    <b class=\"fw-9\">Avoid switching applications: </b>                  </li>                  <p>                    The key to avoiding manual, duplicative work is to ensure                    that your employees can access the software applications                    they use to complete core business processes. Work processes                    enable you to minimize employee time spent on activities                    that would otherwise be required to follow-up or oversight                    to ensure the work has been completed. This centralizing of                    software applications and workflow into the team portal                    create process efficiency across the organization.                  </p>\n                  <li>                    <b class=\"fw-9\">                      Use a platform that allows for personalization of content                      and information:                    </b>                  </li>                  <p>                    Employees need to be able to log into an area where they can                    view, download, and upload private information. The                    information should be organized, labeled, and searchable to                    make finding answers simple. Content should be created,                    prioritized, and refreshed according to what employees are                    most often looking to find. Furthermore, the ability for                    employees to create and personalize their accounts is a                    powerful component. Whenever employees log in they are                    greeted by name and directed to a personalized home page                    loaded with curated information and display articles and                    topics relevant to them. This helps employees feel like                    valued partners with unique preferences.                  </p>\n                  <li>                    <b class=\"fw-9\">Ensure content security: </b>                  </li>                  <p>                    Employees allow users to handle administrative tasks on                    their own without the need for a support ticket or phone                    call that requires a login to provide secure access to                    content and systems. With complete visibility into how                    employees use information, you can continuously improve the                    quality of your content.                  </p>                </ul>              </div>              <div class=\"col-12\">                <p>                  Collaboration is similar to cooperation and requires two or                  more people to complete a task or achieve a goal through                  communication and connection. Collaboration is a coordinated,                  synchronous activity that is the result of a continued attempt                  to construct and maintain a shared conception of a problem.                  While these concepts don’t necessarily change when                  collaboration happens over a digital platform, they can                  certainly become more challenging. These methods ensure a                  smooth transition onto a digital platform for continued and                  optimized workplace productivity in the next normal.                </p>              </div>            </div>          </div>","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"}],"nodeType":"document"}},"path":"/digital-collaboration"},"relatedBlogs":[{"id":"71e61b5d-1b09-557f-a5c5-bdc9f50c83cd","title":"Remote work","description":"Remote work has become increasingly popular in the last five years with the increasing popularity...","path":"/remote-work","img":"images/remote-blog-circle.png"},{"id":"23f6fe36-bf72-5137-bbf0-d621d5b15633","title":"Safe return: What does it mean, and can you do it?","description":"With the onset of COVID-19, the future of work has advanced to the present.
