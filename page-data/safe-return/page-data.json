Until recently, however, it was                  unclear how productivity levels of remote work compared to                  in-office work. The Coronavirus pandemic has made it clear                  that remote work is actually a significantly more productive                  platform. Here’s how you can guarantee that your company is                  able to come out with the same results.                </p>              </div>              <div class=\"col-12\">                <h3 class=\"fw-9 mg-b20 mg-t20\">Managing Accountability</h3>                <p class=\"mg-b20\">                  Managing accountability during a pandemic means that, if                  you’re not already on one, you need to move your team to a                  portal that supports a remote environment. Executives and                  leaders need to make sure that every employee has the tools,                  resources, and solutions to be as productive, creative, and                  secure as possible working from any location and on any                  device.                </p>              </div>              <div class=\"col-12\">                <p>                  For most organizations this means moving shared technologies                  to the cloud, and that migration in turn includes managing                  identity and network access for all users and provides them                  with access to the applications they need to do their jobs. If                  you’re moving your team to a remote portal, make sure it has                  the following features:                </p>                <ul class=\"blog-details__ul\">                  <li>                    <b class=\"fw-9\">Productivity applications: </b>                    Productivity applications enable employees to access                    resources and share files across the web, mobile devices,                    and desktops, store their content in the cloud by default.                    Email, collaboration applications, and content management                    solutions make it easy for employees to do real-time                    co-authoring and commenting on documents, which is extremely                    useful for a distributed workforce.                  </li>                  <li>                    <b class=\"fw-9\">Meetings and collaboration: </b> The                    ability to quickly connect with team members for chat,                    meetings, calls, and collaboration is critical to staying                    productive. Most meetings can be held online with video                    conferencing tools. There are even backgrounds available to                    block out children, pets, and cluttered offices. The ability                    to record meetings is essential so that everyone can access                    information given during meetings they missed.                  </li>                </ul>              </div>              <div class=\"col-12\">                <h3 class=\"fw-9 mg-b20 mg-t20\">                  Motivating teams remotely                </h3>                <p>                  Team members should all contribute and share the workload.                  This means that teams will need an established system for                  performance evaluations and rewards. Individual performance                  evaluations and reward systems are not consistent with                  high-performing teams, so the team portal needs to recognize                  team progress as much–if not more than–individual                  contribution. Here are some ways to motivate your team members                  remotely:                </p>                <ul class=\"blog-details__ul\">                  <li>                    <b class=\"fw-9\">Work Design: </b> The right job design                    can motivate an employee to perform and in the same way, the                    right work design for a group of employees creates                    motivation. Management should strive to give the team                    members work that offers autonomy, skill variety, task                    identity, and task significance. Just like with individuals,                    these features motivate the team and increase their                    effectiveness.                  </li>                  <li>                    <b class=\"fw-9\">Process: </b> This refers to the way the                    team operates, and includes things like common purpose,                    specific goals, team efficacy, and managed conflict levels.                    Having a common purpose provides direction and drives the                    commitment of the team members. Successful teams put a lot                    of time and effort into defining and agreeing on their                    common purpose and will use it as their guiding principle.                  </li>                </ul>              </div>              <div class=\"col-12\">                <p class=\" mg-b20\">                  With all the benefits of remote work come a host of obstacles                  as well. Virtual distance, for example, is a disconnect that                  occurs when employees must heavily rely on smart, digital                  technologies to communicate. Reducing the virtual distance to                  create an environment where team members feel connected to one                  another and the organization can be done by creating a shared                  context, clarifying communication, and frequently taking into                  account organizational and department changes.                </p>                <p>                  <b class=\"fw-9\">                    So how can you help your team thrive despite the distance?                  </b>                  Modern social and engagement platforms available in your                  team’s portal can help make sure messages are heard,                  leadership is visible, and best practices are shared. Make                  sure to think inclusively by providing trainings in live                  events to educate employees to use applications and build                  communities that connect people across teams.                </p>              </div>            </div>          </div>\n","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"}],"nodeType":"document"}},"path":"/safe-return"},"relatedBlogs":[{"id":"71e61b5d-1b09-557f-a5c5-bdc9f50c83cd","title":"Remote work","description":"Remote work has become increasingly popular in the last five years with the increasing popularity...","path":"/remote-work","img":"images/remote-blog-circle.png"},{"id":"cec7d56d-aefb-5cbd-a8aa-4c093cf5f472","title":"The Future of the Workplace ","description":"Everything about work is changing, from where we work, to how we work, and what tools and...
